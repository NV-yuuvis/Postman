# Postman
This Repository holds our yuuvis® Postman collection. 

To import the collection in Postman, open Postmans' import dialogue (CTRL+O) and select our [**collection.json**](./Yuuvis%C2%AE%20Postman%20Collection.postman_collection.json) file.

You'll need to configure your subscription key inside the collection. To do that, hover over the collection in Postman, open its 3Dot context menu and click "Edit". Inside the "Edit" dialogue, head over to the variables tab and fill in your subscription key as the value of the "key" variable. After that, you should be ready to call the yuuvis API using our prepared Postman calls.
